# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes a bike-sharing dataset to understand key trends and patterns in bike usage. The goal is to identify the factors that affect bike rentals and potentially build a model to predict the demand for bikes in the future.

## Project Overview
Bike-sharing systems are widely used for transportation in cities. This project explores the relationships between weather conditions, user behavior, and the demand for bike rentals. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset is collected from [source name] (or provide a link if it's public).
- **Features**:
  - `datetime`: Timestamp for the record
  - `season`: Season (1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter)
  - `holiday`: Whether the day is a holiday
  - `workingday`: Whether the day is a working day
  - `weather`: Weather conditions (1 = clear, 2 = cloudy, 3 = light rain, 4 = heavy rain)
  - `temp`: Temperature in Celsius
  - `humidity`: Humidity percentage
  - `windspeed`: Wind speed in km/h
  - `count`: The number of bike rentals (target variable)
- **Size**: [Number of records] rows and [number of columns] features.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature scaling and transformation
  - Encoding categorical variables
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Time-series analysis of rentals over different periods (hourly, daily, monthly)
  - Analysis of weather conditions vs bike rentals
  - Correlation between features and bike demand
- **Modeling**:
  - Regression techniques to predict bike rentals
  - Models used: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
  - Performance metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
